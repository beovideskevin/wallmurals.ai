# Wall Murals AI

We create interactive murals, using artificial intelligence and augmented reality... Unforgettable branded experiences, combining the oldest form of art with the latest technologies.

This is the website I built for this business. It comes with a web app that allows me to put a layer of virtual reality on top of any mural.

Check our website: [WallMuarls.ai](https://www.wallmurals.ai/)

How does it work? Scan the QR Code on the signage near the artwork to launch the experience. It is all in the web. No application installation needed (friction-less). The viewer records a video or takes a photo. Others can get inside the frame, almost like if they were inside the muralâ€¦ And then shares it online.
